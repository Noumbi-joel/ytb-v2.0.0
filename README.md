## Project Title
Youtube - clone v1.0.0
## Project Description
* This is a v1 of youtube clone in which you can see youtube videos by categories or search videos by **alias or chip or term**, see a page description of a youtube channel and the corresponding videos, finally read your favorite youtube videos via **video player** with **controls**.
* My challenge during the building of this app was to be able to use correctly the **react player library**.
* So basically **react player** is a React component for playing a variety of URLs, including file paths, YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, SoundCloud, Streamable, Vimeo, Wistia, Mixcloud, DailyMotion and Kaltura.
## How to Use
* You just go to: https://next-youtube-nkjy.vercel.app/ and use the version 1 of the app. 
* The particularity is easy to guess **ease of use**.
